# Game

Original Prompt:
You should be choosing the project that you are going to work on soon.

If we think about the steps you should be dealing with, you have the requirements phase in which you should be writing a description of the project you are working on. The requirements document is not a technical definition of the project; it is an overview of the application. This document should be understandable by anyone. You should be describing the application the way that we discussed in the class; a document well enough so that we can analyze the uses of the system.

Second phase is the design phase in which you actually design your system by using UML diagrams, such as use case diagrams and class diagrams (these two are required, others like activity diagrams will earn you some bonus points). To draw these you can use free ArgoUML: http://argouml.tigris.org/. When you are preparing your design document you can use Word or PDF and it should be formal and detailed enough. The requirements document should be included as well. This document serves as a documentation, so any details on how the application is used should be included.  Last phase is the actual implementation of the project. It is a good idea to divide these tasks between yourselves and try to deal with different parts of the system.

Example projects: A Java game which can demonstrate the use of classes, polymorphism, exception handling and various states within the application. A system for ATM (not allowed as it is our example in class), Library, Pharmacy, store (like HEB, Walmart), office, fitness center, etc. (Lots of possibilities here) Basically anything that is complex enough so you can create requirements/design documents and you can demonstrate all the OO concepts that we discussed. You are free to pick any complex project. The day you will present your application is November 23. Good luck!

Some required components:

-Exception Handling

-GUI

-Proper class hierarchy (inheritance/polymorphism/composition)

-Interfaces

-Threading (If needed)
